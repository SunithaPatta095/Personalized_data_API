
Step 1: Setting up the Project
1. Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/).
2. Add dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, and Lombok.

Step 2: Define the Data Models
1. Create a `Shopper` entity to represent the shopper's personalized product list.
2. Create a `Product` entity to represent product metadata.

Step 3: Implement the Repository Interfaces
1. Create a `ShopperRepository` interface extending `JpaRepository<Shopper, String>` for CRUD operations on shopper data.
2. Create a `ProductRepository` interface extending `JpaRepository<Product, String>` for CRUD operations on product data.

Step 4: Implement the Service Layer
1. Create a `ShopperService` interface with methods to interact with shopper data.
2. Create a `ShopperServiceImpl` class implementing the `ShopperService` interface. Implement methods to save and retrieve shopper data.
3. Create a `ProductService` interface with methods to interact with product data.
4. Create a `ProductServiceImpl` class implementing the `ProductService` interface. Implement methods to save and retrieve product data.

Step 5: Implement Controllers
1. Create an `InternalApiController` to handle internal interface requests.
2. Create an `ExternalApiController` to handle external interface requests.

Step 6: Configure Database Connection
1. Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` to configure PostgreSQL database connection.

Step 7: Implement API Endpoints
1. Implement endpoints to receive shopper personalized information and product metadata from the data team.
2. Implement endpoints to provide fast-reading operations for shoppers' personalized information to eCommerce servers.

Step 8: Write Unit Tests
1. Write unit tests to validate the functionality of your service methods.

Step 9: Review and Refactor
1. Review your code for readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
2. Refactor if necessary to improve code quality and maintainability.

Step 10: Push to a Private Repository
1. Push your code to a private repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
